** When searching in the list page or map screen, the user can search by name, favourite restaurants(0 for not favorite, and 1 for favorite), recent inspection hazard level, <= or >= sign and number of critical violations. But the user must keep this order of searching, and also need to separate those criteria by ‘,’.  
(searching order : restaurant name, 1 or 0 for favourite, hazard level, <= or >=, num of critical violation)
(ex.  104 sushi, 1, low, <=, 5)


- When the user search from the restaurant list and then switch to the map screen, it would  AUTOMATICALLY show only the searched restaurants and vice versa.

- The searching part works immediately when the user starts typing not only when pressed enter. (observes text)
